I know this is a repost but I can't for the life of me find the original, so I apologize in advance. Anyway, the bloody audio from the SPL won't stop even after you click off it. How do you make it stop (aside from relogging, going into a game, etc) cheers. The JBL LSR310 Studio Subwoofer is an active 10" Subwoofer that offers the perfect bass extension for studio monitors.

Whats up redditors I want to build a new (high end) pc and start to look for good options. So what is this computer all about? I have 3 things I definitely want to do: - Music Producing: I am a music producer and my laptop starts clipping, if I work on a project with lots of plugins and effects, which stops the workflow. - Machine learning: I want to get into machine learning and data science (especially time data manipulation and optimization of algo parameters) - Hackintosh: Григорий Кашин - про SUNDOWN и SKAR audio, Dodge Ram и автозвук в целом - #miss_spl - Duration: 1 hour, 37 minutes. miss_spl 18,314 views.  
Unfortunately, I'm processing a return amp replace on my Focal Elears, which I purchased due to their purported "gorgeous and incredible low end frequencies." Well, that isn't the case at all for me. The low end is barely audible and when you boost it (using a Fiio E07k for example) it all starts crackling terribly. Loud Pops and Cracks ripping your ear drums apart. Even if you just raise the volume too much (still tame by my standards) without boosting the bass, they're crackling Audio-technica BP893cw-TH Раздел: Головные микрофоны Миниатюрный головной микрофон телесного цвета для радиосистем, предварительно поляризованный конденсаторный, всенаправленный, 20 Гц - 20 кГц, –34 I'm thinking of building dual Full Marty subs this summer and was wondering what recommendations people here have for sub drivers in the 0-0 range. At the moment I'm looking at the Dayton Ultimax 18s. Looking for high output and extension, fine with a bit of harmonic distortion. 
I know this is a music production page, but I also know a lot of you mix your own songs. right? At what volume in general do you mix your songs? It would be great if anyone could share a good website to learn mixing. There are so many posts online and it confuses me more. amp#x200B; Thanks. Hey guys so my question is would a 12 inch sub with a higher sensitivity be twice as loud on the same amp as one with a lower sensitivity?I read doubling power only raises the dB by 3?Im new to all this is why I ask and also what the biggest things to look for in specs in everyone’s opinion. I just finished installing the following into my '99 Civic LX: - Kenwood DPX500bt head unit - Inifinity Kappa 6.5's (had to cut out the door cup) - Inifinity Kappa 6x9's - SPL Audio GLA1-4500D (Mono Amp - 1ohm stable) - Rockford Fosgate P2-2x12 in RF box (both at 1ohm) I need some help in how exactly to tune the amp. I have tuned a Multichannel before but it's been years. Any advice. Are there any iPad apps out there that will accept an external source? I'm just not sure I trust the internal mic. If there is an app that can do it, I was thinking of getting something like the Focusrite interface that goes down to a lighting end,or some other interface that'll do that or 3.5mm. And I have a Earthworks M30. Curious if that would work, or if it's a terrible idea. Or if there's a better way to go about. 
Hello all you audio nerds out there. I'd like to pick your brain about recording VERY high SPL audio, clearly, in a very windy environment. My apologies in advance, but this is going to be a long and very detailed post. If it is TL;DR-- Go to "The Idea" section of the post I'm an IT engineer and avid motorcyce enthusiast and I like to record my rides with a GoPro so I can go back and review and learn from mistakes, as well as share my awesome roads and scenery I just bought a pair of Yamaha HS8s and an Apollo Twin Dual Core Audio interface. I ended up just hooking up my monitors to my Mac with a 3.5mm TRS to dual 1/4” TS cable. The monitors sound great, but the Guitar Center guy told me I almost certainly need an audio interface to mix properly. My question is, do I really need the Apollo? I don’t record vocals, and there doesn’t seem to be any issues with connecting the monitors directly to my aux port. Thanks. This thing looks rad, always love the SSL sound and workflow, but prefer other pres for tracking. Any of you worked on one of these 
This sub has been super helpful. I see a lot of posts asking for advice on which speakers to purchase for movies/music; I on the other hand am a sports guy. 75% live sports, 25% sports video games. I’m in the midst of replacing my current setup so is there something specific I should be looking for in speakers to give me a great audio experience specific to sports. Show me whatever has caught Holy cow that audio mix was loud! 
I have a bachelors in electrical engineering so I'm familiar with bode plots and fourier analysis and FFT's and audio compression and signal processing and that. But no one ever told me what the difference between volume and gain is from a technical standpoint. I know the difference between gain and distortion. But the difference between volume and gain is one that I don't know. I (think I) know of that volume has something to do with how much of the air is vibrating with your sound I'm thinking of using Turbosound ip1000 column for home theater use. What do you think? What are the pros and cons for using such a speaker instead of a stereo receiver + 2 speakers? (my budget is about 1000USD) amp#x200B; Thanks. Assuming My OnePlus 5 won't get me the full potential of HD 58X, what is the cheapest amp that will be good enough? Also, would you say its sound signature is "fun" or more analytical and natural like the HD 600 for example? (I'm currently using Bose On-Ear Wireless and really like the sound signature, with emphasized bass and recessed treble). i'm planing to move to linux as my next os and i wonder if i can make it work there, it has drivers only for mac and windows. I work during the matches all the time and would like to watch/listen but my Mixer app is just constantly freezing and was curious What are your goals for your car audio system - as loud as possible (SPL)? Sound quality (SQ)? Some combination of both? Describe to us how you want your system to sound. I would just like to add more bass than is present in the HK sound system. From the research I've done it seems like a 12" sub would meet my needs as I'm not trying to shake the neighborhood, just shake the car a bit. What vehicle? - year, make, model, type (coupe, sedan, SUV, truck, etc.) 2016 subaru wrx - limit. Anyone know if there is any truth to this? He said he will do it if I can get a car electrician or car audio specialist to ok the install. Keep in mind my mechanic is pretty old school so this whole car audio thing is not part of his expertise. Anyway not sure what other info you might need to give me your thoughts on this but here I go. Mechman Alternator custom built for my car (and the car model). Car also has an aftermarket battery I installed. here is info on the battery. Honda. SPL developes audio gear for music, film, multimedia, hifi and broadcast.
