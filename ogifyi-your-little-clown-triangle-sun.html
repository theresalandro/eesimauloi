I remember the first time I was snapped from my cartoon laced delusion. I lost a part of my childlike innocence that day that helped shape my views of the World forever. My older sister and I were watching television like we did every evening before bed. It was the early 90’s. I was barely six years old, my sister was almost nine. A special report from Illinois popped on the TV showing a large man. He wore a sinister

I met Gaines by the start line and accepted my pack from a surly man in a Superman shirt. “Man,” I said as I shrugged into it. “This sure feels like more than 45 pounds.” “Well, you can quit anytime you like, sweetheart,” surly man said. I smiled at him. “Not a chance, cupcake.” My smile widened as his face reddened and he stalked away. “What a wanker,” Gaines muttered. “Me or him?” I asked. Gaines laughed. “Him.

Hi all! This is a project I have been working on for quite some time. I know playing YGO cube format isn't a new idea, but when I, a primarily MTG player who takes an interest in YGO on the side, discovered the standard was to change the rules and treat all monsters as all types, I was horrified! That’s not Yu-Gi-Oh! So I set out to design a cube that allowed the drafting of archetypes of all kinds, and allowed for the creation of interesting decks. Then, I mentioned this to some magic players.

Second off, what I'm trying to pull off with my narration is a lovecraftian style (wordiness and all) and my dialogue, I feel, needs to be sloppy to have a nice counter balance.

Scary stories and rumors, usually conjured up to convince the young kids to behave and not to stay out past their bedtimes. As I understand it, it wasn’t always this way. We moved to town two months ago in mid-August and immediately it became apparent that Findlay took this time of year really seriously. Apparently it’s coming up on two years almost to the day since a small string of seemingly random murders occurred Listen, mate. Something is rotten in the State of Victoria, Australia. From the muddy banks of the Yarra, up and beyond Sydney Road, to the Dandenong mountain ranges….down to the borders of Port Phillip Bay where the fibreglass Luna Park clown, old Mr Moon, grins contemptuously over the brothels and slums of St Kilda.

It’s a compelling story…. Skylab - America’s first Space Station, is launched in 1973. The first crew, led by the third man on the Moon, repairs damage caused during launch, saving the habitat for continued use.

I know being molested as a kid really hurt me. I hope it isn't happening to anyone but the codes seem to indicate it is. I pray for an end of any suffering. Maybe the world can stop fighting each other and being racist. We are all equal. We are all trying to have a good life. My motto is I try to sin less today than yesterday and even less tomorrow. Can we all try that, please? I've had racist thoughts. -1- For as far back as I can remember, my family has had the same summer tradition. On the second Friday after the last day of school we would cram all our camping gear into dad's old station wagon, before driving four hours to a campground located in the dead center of middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania. When we got there we did all the normal things that one would expect from an average family camping trip. We fished, went hiking, made smores, and told each other ghost stories. But the centerp. So this is a list of a shit ton of Exotic (and other tier) weapons, armor, ships, sparrows, artifacts, and shaders I came up with. I posted this to Bungie.net awhile ago, and like no one commented.

When I was 16, my friend Alex told me the most messed up story of my life. My parent's went out of town, so I did the cliché thing and threw a house party. Well tried to, 5 guys showed and my friend Alex, I wasn't very popular. We decided to watch a horror movie and have the beer anyway, because no girls had come, and basically just started treating as a sleep over with booze. We all lounged around the TV, laying on the sofa and the floor, sipping beers, as IT by Stephen King started playing. The Wydell family lived on Springwood Drive in the small town of Ash, Texas. Alex was your typical 8 year old, he liked bugs, hot dogs, and especially comic books. This decrepit town was once one of the top railroad junction towns in the country, but now it was just a graveyard of warehouse buildings and crumbling homes. Jim and Alice Wydell ran the town’s animal shelter, and rather enjoyed it, but recently an abnormally high number of animals were being reported missing. It was mid March ####LIVE!
